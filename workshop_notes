steps:

- start a shiny project
- use a template e.g. flexdashboard
- ui vs. server
  - single 'app' vs. separate files
      - makes no difference
      - if gets unwieldy probably easier with separate
- refer to cheatsheet
- put needed libraries at the top of any script
    - load only what is necessary
    - there may be issues with dependencies when trying to deploy
- start with server
  - e.g. do basic data manipulation
- go to ui input
  - display a simple result of previous
- expand
  - add options
  - change width
  - change layout
- add additional components
  - extend previous to include reactive component
  - Take advantage of document outline of script
- demo dashboard

issues:

- little is inuitive, nor will prior R experience help much
- anything non-trivial will probably be a PITA
  - but what you want to do has probably has been done and you can find help on SE
  - many shiny examples, e.g. gallery, show code that will actually be of use to you
- debugging is difficult at best
- documentation poor
  - help files often don't contain examples
  - many demos docs are too simplisitic to be of much use beyond very basic
- standard conditionals and other programming basics may require a lot of time to pull off correctly
