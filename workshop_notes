steps:

  start a shiny project (or possibly flexdashboard)
  ui vs. server; single 'app' vs. separate files
  keep content within sidebar, but comment out (use as reference)
  refer to cheatsheet
  put needed libraries at the top of any script
  start with server, do basic data manipulation
  go to input, display a simple result of previous
  expand
  change layout
  debugging (difficult at best)
  demo dashboard

issues:

  little is inuitive, nor will prior R experience help much
  anything non-trivial will probably be a PITA
  documentation poor
  standard conditionals and other programming basics may require a lot of time to pull off correctly
